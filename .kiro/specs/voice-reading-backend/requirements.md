# Backend Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the Voice Reading App backend API. The backend will provide user management, data synchronization, AI services, and file storage capabilities to support the existing Next.js frontend application designed for visually impaired users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication and Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create an account and securely authenticate so that I can sync my reading data across multiple devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers with email and password THEN the system SHALL create a secure user account with encrypted password storage
2. WHEN a user logs in with valid credentials THEN the system SHALL return a JWT token for API authentication
3. WHEN a user requests password reset THEN the system SHALL send a secure reset link via email
4. WHEN an authenticated user updates their profile THEN the system SHALL validate and persist the changes
5. IF a user provides invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages without revealing account existence

### Requirement 2: Book Management and Storage

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload and store my books on the server so that I can access them from any device and share storage across platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a book file (PDF, EPUB, TXT) THEN the system SHALL parse metadata and store the file securely
2. WHEN a user requests their book library THEN the system SHALL return all books with metadata and access permissions
3. WHEN a user deletes a book THEN the system SHALL remove both metadata and file storage while preserving related notes
4. WHEN the system processes a book upload THEN it SHALL extract text content for search and AI processing
5. IF a book upload fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and cleanup partial uploads

### Requirement 3: Data Synchronization Services

**User Story:** As a user, I want my reading positions, notes, and preferences synchronized across all my devices so that I can seamlessly continue reading anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user's reading position changes THEN the system SHALL update the position across all authenticated devices
2. WHEN a user creates or modifies notes THEN the system SHALL sync the changes to all connected devices
3. WHEN user preferences are updated THEN the system SHALL propagate changes to all user sessions
4. WHEN sync conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL resolve using last-write-wins with timestamp comparison
5. IF a device is offline THEN the system SHALL queue sync operations for when connectivity is restored

### Requirement 4: AI Integration Services

**User Story:** As a user, I want server-side AI processing for book summarization and content analysis so that I get consistent, high-quality results optimized for Vietnamese language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests a chapter summary THEN the system SHALL generate a Vietnamese-optimized summary using OpenAI API
2. WHEN AI processing is requested THEN the system SHALL cache results to improve performance and reduce API costs
3. WHEN the AI service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide fallback responses and retry mechanisms
4. WHEN processing Vietnamese content THEN the system SHALL use language-specific prompts and models
5. IF AI quota is exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting and inform users appropriately

### Requirement 5: File Storage and Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want reliable file storage for my books and generated content so that my data is secure and accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL store them in secure, scalable cloud storage
2. WHEN files are requested THEN the system SHALL provide authenticated access with appropriate permissions
3. WHEN storage quota is approached THEN the system SHALL notify users and provide management options
4. WHEN files are deleted THEN the system SHALL ensure complete removal from all storage locations
5. IF storage operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide retry mechanisms and error recovery

### Requirement 6: API Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the API to be performant and scalable so that it can handle multiple users and voice processing workloads efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN response times SHALL be under 200ms for data operations
2. WHEN multiple users access the system THEN it SHALL handle concurrent requests without performance degradation
3. WHEN heavy processing is required THEN the system SHALL use background job queues
4. WHEN database queries are executed THEN they SHALL be optimized with proper indexing and caching
5. IF system load increases THEN the architecture SHALL support horizontal scaling

### Requirement 7: Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As a user, I want my personal data and voice interactions to be secure and private so that I can trust the application with sensitive information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is transmitted THEN all communications SHALL use HTTPS/TLS encryption
2. WHEN user data is stored THEN sensitive information SHALL be encrypted at rest
3. WHEN API requests are made THEN they SHALL be authenticated and authorized appropriately
4. WHEN voice data is processed THEN it SHALL not be permanently stored on servers
5. IF security breaches are detected THEN the system SHALL have monitoring and incident response procedures

### Requirement 8: Monitoring and Logging

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and logging so that I can maintain system health and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are processed THEN the system SHALL log request details and response times
2. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient context for debugging
3. WHEN system metrics change THEN monitoring SHALL alert administrators of potential issues
4. WHEN users report problems THEN logs SHALL provide traceability for issue resolution
5. IF performance degrades THEN monitoring SHALL identify bottlenecks and resource constraints
