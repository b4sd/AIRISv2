# Backend Implementation Plan

## ðŸš€ Development Strategy

This implementation plan follows a **monorepo approach** with the backend built using **Fastify + TypeScript**. The tasks are designed to be incremental, allowing for testing and validation at each step while building toward a production-ready API.

### Repository Structure

```
voice-reading-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/          # Existing Next.js app (moved from airis/)
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/           # New Fastify API server
â”œâ”€â”€ shared/            # Shared TypeScript types and utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml # Development environment
â””â”€â”€ deploy/            # Production deployment configs
```

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Jest for service layer and utilities
