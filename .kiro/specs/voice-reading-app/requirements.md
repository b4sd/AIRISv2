# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a voice-interactive reading application website built with Next.js. The application will allow users to interact with books through voice commands, including opening books, listening to text-to-speech narration, getting AI-powered summaries, and taking notes. The system will provide a hands-free reading experience that enhances accessibility and user engagement.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a reader, I want to use voice commands to open and navigate books, so that I can access my reading material hands-free.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user says "open [book title]" THEN the system SHALL search for and display the requested book
2. WHEN a user says "go to chapter [number/name]" THEN the system SHALL navigate to the specified chapter
3. WHEN a user says "go to page [number]" THEN the system SHALL navigate to the specified page
4. WHEN a user says "next page" or "previous page" THEN the system SHALL navigate accordingly
5. IF the requested book is not found THEN the system SHALL provide voice feedback indicating the book is unavailable

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a reader, I want the website to read books aloud to me, so that I can listen to content while multitasking or when I prefer audio consumption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user says "read aloud" or "start reading" THEN the system SHALL begin text-to-speech narration from the current position
2. WHEN a user says "pause" or "stop reading" THEN the system SHALL pause the narration
3. WHEN a user says "resume reading" THEN the system SHALL continue narration from where it was paused
4. WHEN a user says "read faster" or "read slower" THEN the system SHALL adjust the speech rate accordingly
5. WHEN a user says "change voice" THEN the system SHALL cycle through available voice options
6. IF narration is interrupted by other voice commands THEN the system SHALL pause reading and resume after command completion

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a reader, I want to request summaries of book content through voice commands, so that I can quickly understand key points without reading entire sections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user says "summarize this chapter" THEN the system SHALL generate and present an AI-powered summary of the current chapter
2. WHEN a user says "summarize this page" THEN the system SHALL generate and present a summary of the current page content
3. WHEN a user says "summarize the whole book" THEN the system SHALL generate and present a comprehensive book summary
4. WHEN a user says "read the summary aloud" THEN the system SHALL use text-to-speech to narrate the generated summary
5. IF summary generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide voice feedback explaining the issue

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a reader, I want to take and manage notes using voice commands, so that I can capture thoughts and insights without interrupting my reading flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user says "take a note" followed by their note content THEN the system SHALL create and save a new note linked to the current reading position
2. WHEN a user says "show my notes" THEN the system SHALL display all notes for the current book
3. WHEN a user says "read my notes" THEN the system SHALL use text-to-speech to narrate the user's notes
4. WHEN a user says "delete last note" THEN the system SHALL remove the most recently created note
5. WHEN a user says "search notes for [keyword]" THEN the system SHALL find and display notes containing the specified keyword
6. IF note-taking fails THEN the system SHALL provide voice feedback and allow the user to retry

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the website to accurately recognize and respond to my voice commands, so that I can interact with the application reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user speaks a command THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback indicating it is listening
2. WHEN speech recognition is successful THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation of the recognized command
3. WHEN speech recognition fails THEN the system SHALL ask the user to repeat their command
4. WHEN background noise interferes THEN the system SHALL filter noise and attempt to recognize the command
5. IF the user's microphone is not accessible THEN the system SHALL display an error message and provide alternative input methods

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my book library and reading preferences, so that I can customize my reading experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user says "show my library" THEN the system SHALL display all available books
2. WHEN a user says "add book" THEN the system SHALL provide options for uploading or importing books
3. WHEN a user says "bookmark this page" THEN the system SHALL save the current reading position
4. WHEN a user says "go to bookmark" THEN the system SHALL navigate to the saved reading position
5. WHEN a user says "set reading speed to [speed]" THEN the system SHALL save the preference for future reading sessions
6. IF book upload fails THEN the system SHALL provide error feedback and suggest alternative formats

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work seamlessly across different devices and browsers, so that I can access my reading experience anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive interface optimized for touch and voice
2. WHEN a user switches between devices THEN the system SHALL sync reading progress and notes
3. WHEN a user uses different browsers THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent functionality
4. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL provide offline reading capabilities for downloaded books
5. IF browser compatibility issues occur THEN the system SHALL display appropriate fallback options
