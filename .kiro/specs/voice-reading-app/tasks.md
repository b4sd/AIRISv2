# Implementation Plan

## üß™ Testing Strategy for Accessibility-First Development

**CRITICAL: Since this app is designed for visually impaired users, testing must be done after every task with:**

### Essential Testing Tools:

- **Screen Readers**: NVDA (Windows), JAWS (Windows), VoiceOver (Mac/iOS), TalkBack (Android)
- **Voice Recognition**: Test in Chrome, Edge, Safari with Vietnamese language
- **Accessibility Audits**: axe-core, WAVE, Lighthouse accessibility score
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Test all functionality without mouse
- **Mobile Testing**: iOS Safari + VoiceOver, Android Chrome + TalkBack

### Testing Checklist After Each Task:

1. ‚úÖ **Voice Commands Work** - Test Vietnamese voice recognition accuracy
2. ‚úÖ **Screen Reader Compatibility** - All content announced correctly
3. ‚úÖ **Keyboard Navigation** - Tab order logical, all features accessible
4. ‚úÖ **Error Handling** - Errors announced to screen readers
5. ‚úÖ **Mobile Accessibility** - Works with mobile screen readers
6. ‚úÖ **Performance** - Voice processing doesn't block UI

### Critical Voice Commands to Test:

- "M·ªü s√°ch [t√™n s√°ch]" (Open book)
- "ƒê·ªçc to cho t√¥i nghe" (Read aloud)
- "T√≥m t·∫Øt ch∆∞∆°ng n√†y" (Summarize chapter)
- "Ghi ch√∫: [n·ªôi dung]" (Take note)
- "Chuy·ªÉn trang ti·∫øp theo" (Next page)
- "Tr·ª£ gi√∫p" (Help)
