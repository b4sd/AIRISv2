# Implementation Plan

## üîÑ Hybrid Storage Architecture

**UPDATED APPROACH: The app now uses a hybrid storage system combining local IndexedDB with cloud synchronization:**

### Storage Strategy:

- **Local-First**: All data stored in IndexedDB for offline access
- **Cloud Sync**: Automatic synchronization with backend API when online
- **Guest Mode**: Full functionality without account creation
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Users can optionally create accounts for multi-device sync

### Data Flow:

```
User Action ‚Üí IndexedDB (immediate) ‚Üí Background Sync ‚Üí Cloud Storage
                ‚Üì
         Immediate UI Update
```

### Sync Behavior:

- **Offline**: Full functionality with IndexedDB only
- **Online**: Automatic background sync with conflict resolution
- **Multi-device**: Last-write-wins with timestamp comparison
- **Migration**: Seamless upgrade from guest to authenticated user

## üß™ Testing Strategy for Accessibility-First Development

**CRITICAL: Since this app is designed for visually impaired users, testing must be done after every task with:**

### Essential Testing Tools:

- **Screen Readers**: NVDA (Windows), JAWS (Windows), VoiceOver (Mac/iOS), TalkBack (Android)
- **Voice Recognition**: Test in Chrome, Edge, Safari with Vietnamese language
- **Accessibility Audits**: axe-core, WAVE, Lighthouse accessibility score
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Test all functionality without mouse
- **Mobile Testing**: iOS Safari + VoiceOver, Android Chrome + TalkBack

### Testing Checklist After Each Task:

1. ‚úÖ **Voice Commands Work** - Test Vietnamese voice recognition accuracy
2. ‚úÖ **Screen Reader Compatibility** - All content announced correctly
3. ‚úÖ **Keyboard Navigation** - Tab order logical, all features accessible
4. ‚úÖ **Error Handling** - Errors announced to screen readers
5. ‚úÖ **Mobile Accessibility** - Works with mobile screen readers
6. ‚úÖ **Performance** - Voice processing doesn't block UI

### Critical Voice Commands to Test:

- "M·ªü s√°ch [t√™n s√°ch]" (Open book)
- "ƒê·ªçc to cho t√¥i nghe" (Read aloud)
- "T√≥m t·∫Øt ch∆∞∆°ng n√†y" (Summarize chapter)
- "Ghi ch√∫: [n·ªôi dung]" (Take note)
- "Chuy·ªÉn trang ti·∫øp theo" (Next page)
- "Tr·ª£ gi√∫p" (Help)
